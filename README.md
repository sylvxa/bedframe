# Bedframe

## Premise

Translation layer that converts textured/custom server-side Polymer blocks and items to native Bedrock representations.

## Requirements

- [Geyser-Fabric](https://geysermc.org/download)
- [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)

You also probably want Polymer's Auto-Host feature, but Bedframe doesn't require it.
