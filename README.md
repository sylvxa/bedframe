# Bedframe

## Premise

Translation layer that converts textured/custom server-side Polymer blocks and items to native Bedrock representations.

## Requirements

- [Geyser-Fabric](https://geysermc.org/download)
- [Polymer (or a mod that uses it and its resource pack features)](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)

You also probably want Polymer's Auto-Host feature, but Bedframe doesn't require it.

## Compatibility

- Works perfectly with [More Furnaces (Polymer)](https://modrinth.com/mod/morefurnaces)*

## Limitations & Goals

- Custom models (a.k.a non-full-block or cross-block) do not work
- Entities are not touched
